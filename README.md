# kams_repo
Hi I am kamaljeet and I am currently a part-time Open University Engineering Student and a full time HGV-Driver. 
I would love to welcome you to my repo for my personal portifolio of projects where I could demonstrate what I have learned so far.
Right now a copy of tic_tac_toe written is C# is used as a test project to familiarize myself with github.
I am planning to add other projects such as solidwork models and other softwares I may like to write throughout the year.

Current Projects: tic tac toe (available on the test branch).
Future Projects:  - windows forms: Bank application.
                  - tic tac toe for cross platform devices (Xamarin forms).
